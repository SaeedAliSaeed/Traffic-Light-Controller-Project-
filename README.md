# Traffic-Light-Controller-Project-
This project implements a traffic light controller system for a two-way intersection using a PIC16F877A microcontroller. The intersection consists of two perpendicular streets: West Street South Street Each street follows a specific light sequence (Red, Yellow, Green) with different timing intervals.
